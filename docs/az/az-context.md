# AZ Context

This repository is linked to an on-chain AZ proposal for research funding only.

The AZ proposal:

- does not imply implementation
- does not represent an official roadmap
- does not commit Zenon to shipping these ideas

Its sole purpose is to:

- anchor authorship and intent on-chain
- allow the community to evaluate research work transparently
- demonstrate Zenon’s ability to fund non-normative research

All documents in this repository remain exploratory.
