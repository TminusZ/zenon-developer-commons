# AZ Research Proposal (On-Chain)

This repository is accompanied by an active AZ proposal submitted on-chain
to fund and formalize continued research.

The proposal covers the full scope of work in this repository, including:
- Header-only verification
- Bounded inclusion
- Minimal state frontier verification
- Associated hostile reviews and boundary specifications

The purpose of the AZ proposal is:
- to demonstrate how Zenon governance can fund research directly
- to anchor authorship and intent on-chain
- to allow the community to evaluate, approve, or reject continued work

No implementation or roadmap is implied by this proposal.
This is a research-only funding request.
