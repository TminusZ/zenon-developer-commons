Zenon Developer Commons

A public, community-driven space for exploring and documenting the technical architecture of Zenon — The Network of Momentum (NoM).

This repository serves as:

a space for ongoing research into whether Zenon’s architecture can support a browser-native, proof-verified light client using technologies like WebRTC and libp2p.

a neutral hub for engineering research

a place to organize architecture insights

a space to publish design notes, proposals, and analysis

and a way for developers to collaborate without relying on chatrooms or politics

The goal is simple:
make Zenon’s deeper technical ideas easier to explore, discover, and understand.

## Why This Repository Exists

Zenon is an unconventional architecture combining:

deterministic, VM-free contract interfaces

modular execution layers

dual-token economics

peer-to-peer communication primitives

and unique concepts like Sentries, Pillars, and Accelerators

However, much of Zenon’s design intent is:

scattered

undocumented

buried in old chats

or never fully explained publicly

This repository provides a structured place to collect, clarify, and refine that knowledge.

## What This Repository Is Not

This is not:

a governance tool

a decision-making authority

a replacement for core devs

a political or social channel

a roadmap for the ecosystem

It’s simply an open research space for technical thinkers who want to explore how Zenon works — or how it could evolve.

## Initial Research Areas

This repository will host structured documents and discussions around topics such as:

Architecture

NoM design overview

Account-based vs momentum-based models

Deterministic contract interfaces (ACIs)

Sentry node conceptual design

Fusion, Plasma, and QSR mechanics

Potential Future Directions

Browser-native light clients

libp2p transports for Zenon

WebRTC peer-to-peer connectivity

Proof-serving nodes

Off-chain execution models

Open Questions

What parts of NoM were intentionally designed for light clients or browser-native nodes?

How does Zenon achieve executable logic without a VM?

What are the roles of Sentries within the architecture?

How do extension chains fit into the long-term model?

## How to Contribute

You do not need to be an expert.
You only need genuine curiosity.

You can contribute by:

Opening issues for questions or research topics

Adding documents under /docs

Creating diagrams

Posting architecture notes

Starting GitHub Discussions

All contributions should remain:

technical

respectful

calm

exploratory

This is a place for collaboration, not confrontation.
