# Essays

This directory contains long-form essays originally published on [Substack](https://zenonaliencommons.substack.com/).

They are preserved here as plain Markdown to make them durable, citable, and easy to read alongside technical material. These pieces are not announcements, tutorials, or documentation. They are exploratory essays—philosophical, architectural, and reflective in nature.

No attempt has been made to reformat or decompose them beyond light Markdown cleanup. Revisions, if any, will be quiet and tracked through Git history.

For readers looking for formal specifications or implementation details, see the `/docs` directory.
